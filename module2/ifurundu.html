				<h2> Hawaiian White Hibiscus</h2>
				<p>This beautiful Hawaiian species is a shrub or a small tree, depending on its natural growth habit and how it is trained. The flowers are pure white with light pink pistils that accent the loose open form. Although they are known to flower throughout the year on their native islands, it tends to bloom mostly in summer. When in bloom, the growing tips are inundated with buds and flowers emerge daily for weeks. They are quite vigorous, have an upright habit and do best in a full sun exposure.

				The large white flowers are mildly fragrant. Some people canâ€™t smell them as the fragrance is quite subtle. They are best sniffed when the wind is calm and in the early morning just after it opens or early evening just before it closes.</p>
